The city's mayor have a plan to reconstruct the city. She want to knock down all the old towers in the subturb and give this job to Cybebe.

There are n towers, the i_th tower has towers i height. When one tower get collapsed, the near towers which is lower or equal will collapse too because of concussion.

Return the list of index of towers which Cybebe should bomb it. This should take as few bombs as possible.

Example:

Input: towers = [10, 5, 2, 3, 11, 7]  
Output: [0, 4]

Input: towers = [3, 7, 2, 3, 7, 11, 15, 8, 11, 9]
Output: [1, 6, 8]


Constraint:  
1 <= towers.length <= 20  
1 <= piles[i] <= 100
